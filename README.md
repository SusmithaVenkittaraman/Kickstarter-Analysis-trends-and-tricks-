# Kickstarter-Analysis-trends-and-tricks-

   Kickstarter is a global crowdfunding platform that brings life to creative ideas. The projects have the goals set, and statistics say that only a third of the proposed projects are successful. To increase the project's success rate, the goal seekers take up the data-driven path using past projects' outcomes to uncover insights and use them to their advantage. In this project, Kickstarter's past project data has been organized and analyzed to discover some tricks and trends that will help achieve success through this crowdfunding platform.
